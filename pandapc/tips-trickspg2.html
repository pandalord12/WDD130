                <p class="msg1">Honestly, the very first thing you should know before building a PC or trying to figure out what parts to buy, is too do these three things. 
                    <br>1. How much can/are you willing to spend, having a budget is super important, prices can get crazy really fast. 
                    <br>2. Is knowing what you are going to be doing on the computer and you want it to be able to do, you dont want to over pay for a computer you dont use often, you also dont want to build one that you will have to sell and replace because it cant do what you need it to. 
                    <br>3. Make sure that the parts your are looking at work together and you do the right research for quality and price.
                    <br>All of these points are exactly what do when I start a build and what I can do for you, if it seems like a little much you can give me your budget and what you want games you want to play or what you want it to do and I can put the time in to find the balance!</p>

                <p class="msg2">The very important lesson I learned while doing my first build, was the importance of adequate cooling! Wether you use all liquid cooling, just airflow cooling or mix of both, you have to make sure you can keep it cold! If you add pretty light to the fans in your build and then it can look and run cool! </p>

                <p class="msg3">My last tip is to make sure you put enough storage space in the build. Computers can get old and slow down, but if you make sure your build has the right parts for longevity, you will be able to use your computer for years! Storage can affect how fast your computers runs programs, boots up, and if you keep and lot of digital stuff or big programs you wont have to buy more storage or get a computer with better storage.</p>
