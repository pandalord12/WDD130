                <p class="msg0">I have always been a fan of computers and building, working, on them, playing video games. Computers are like really expensive legos, that run video games and other programs. My first Computer build was acutally for my senior project on High School, and from that point I kept building them for fun, or to sell to friends and others.</p>

                <p class="msg1">My Father works in the computer world during college and he introduced me to working on them when I was younger so it cool to build my own and have him help and oversee. Since my first build I have been doing by self I have tools, space, and know how. So if you want your own custom PC for games or work, please contact me!</p>
