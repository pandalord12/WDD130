    <p>My degree for right now is cybersecurity</p>
    <p>Not married lol</p>
    <p>I think web design is cool, but it has always been a little confusing and out of my element, so I am excited to see how it goes.</p>
    <p>I have been a Member of the Church my whole life, my favorite scripture is Alma 32:21, and my favorite quote is anything by Elder Holland.</p>
    <p>I love to hangout with friends, watch movies, listen to music, play video games, I build custom PC's and I work on cars in my free time. I love swimming, cooking, and just having a good time.</p>
